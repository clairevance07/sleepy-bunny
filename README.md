# Sleepy Bunny 🐰

[My Notes](notes.md)



## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

Sleepy Bunny is an adorable sleep log app where you improve the mood and energy of your virtual pet rabbit by achieving your sleep goals. 

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

If there's one thing teenagers and young adults frequently complain about, it's how exhausted they are. However, they usually don't take time to fix their sleep schedules. Sleepy Bunny instantly brings awareness to how much sleep you're getting. Not only can you set a sleep goal, log your hours, and share your progress with friends, but your bunny mirrors the effects of your sleep duration; if you slept four hours last night, you can bet your bunny will be nearly falling asleep. This fluffy friend is exactly what you need to get your sleep schedule back on track.

### Design

The app will consist of three main parts: the login, track, and friends pages. The login page is where a user can create an account or log in to an existing account so that their data is saved. The tracking page is the main page of the application, which includes the user's bunny, who will be animated based on mood, and two popup windows: goal and progress. The goal popup will allow the user to see and edit the window they want to be asleep during and how many hours of sleep they want to get per night. The progress window will show a calendar with the days that the user hit their sleep goal shaded in. On the friends page, the user can see the progress of the friends they've added and send praise, and they can also add new friends with the friend's username.

### Key features

- An adorable pet rabbit who greets you immediately after you sign in. This virtual pet reflects your mood based on your sleep schedule; he'll be exhausted if you didn't sleep well and energetic if you hit your goals.
- Progress monitoring. It's easy to see how consistent you've been at a glance through the shaded calendar feature.
- Friends! Staying on track is always easier with friends, and Sleepy Bunny makes it easy for you to check in on your friends and send them encouraging messages.
