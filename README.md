# Sleepy Bunny 🐰

[My Notes](notes.md)



## 🚀 Specification Deliverable

Sleepy Bunny is an adorable sleep log app where you improve the mood and energy of your virtual pet rabbit by achieving your sleep goals. 

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [ ] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [ ] Description of key features
- [ ] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

If there's one thing teenagers and young adults frequently complain about, it's how exhausted they are. However, they usually don't take time to fix their sleep schedules. Sleepy Bunny instantly brings awareness to how much sleep you're getting. Not only can you set a sleep goal, log your hours, and share your progress with friends, but your bunny mirrors the effects of your sleep duration; if you slept four hours last night, you can bet your bunny will be nearly falling asleep. This fluffy friend is exactly what you need to get your sleep schedule back on track.
